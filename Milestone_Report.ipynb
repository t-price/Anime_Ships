    " The goal of this project is to gather and analyze data on *My Hero Academia* and its related fanfiction writings by web-scraping Archive of Our Own, *My Hero Academia* Episodes Wikipedia page, and *My Hero Academia* Chapters Wikipedia page. The data will include information on any \"ships\" from the fanfictions, the number of fanfiction writings published during different periods of time, the \"hits\" a fanfiction receives, \"kudos\" for the fanfiction, the characters in the show, the viewership ratings, original air date, English air date, titles of the episodes, and the season of the episodes. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify discernible patterns or trends that indicate increases in \"hits,\" based on the character \"ships\" in the fanfiction. We also aim to find if there are increases in fanfictions being written or changes in the fan \"ships\" when the show is released. This information can be used by producers and writers to understand the impact of their work on the audience and to make decisions about the future of *My Hero Academia*."

    "We have data from all the current seasons of *My Hero Academia* anime, there are a total of six seasons. It has been cleaned of unnecessary columns and rows. The dates have been converted to pandas datetime format to be usable for analysis. The six seasons have 11 columns: No.overall (Overall number in the whole anime series), the No.inseason (Episode number), Title, Storyboarded by, Directed by, Written by, Original air date, English air date, Viewership rating, Original_Air_Date (pandas datetime format), and English_Air_Date (pandas datatime format).

    "There are several ethical data concerns that need to be considered for our project. Firstly web-scraping can be illegal. We checked the website's terms, Wikipedia and Archive of Our Own, and they do not mention web-scraping, but there are a multitude of examples and walk-throughs to web-scrape from these websites and neither offer separate API's to web-scrape. Secondly, we have to consider the privacy of the users writing the fanfictions and ensure we are protecting their privacy. Any identifiable personal information will be made anonymous if we scrape it, such as usernames. Thirdly, we must make sure we only use this data for our project as outlined and that we don't use it for any other purpose. Lastly, the results of our analysis must be presented in a way that does not harm any individuals or communities from the *My Hero Academia* fanbase or authors, such as perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases. We will do this by analyzing the data objectively and any conclusions we make are drawn based solely on the data and not on preconceived notions or biases. "

We have figured the features we want now and our must-have features are: \"ships\" from the fanfictions, the \"hits\" the fanfiction receives, the publish date of the fanfiction, and original air dates episodes and chapters. Our optional features are: the characters involved, viewership ratings, titles of the episode or chapters. Our stakeholder analysis was comprehensive with specific ethical issues.\n",

The clean-up should be a moderate amount due to the web-scraping we had to do, but it shouldn't be more than what was taught in class.
