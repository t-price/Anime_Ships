Bakugo then learns the history of One For All and vows to keep it a secret as he and Izuku are suspended from classes for a few days (Bakugo got a four day suspension as he started the fight while Izuku got suspended for three days), All Might believing this outcome necessary to help the two become proper rivals in their quests to become heroes.

The Shie Hassaikai member Joi Irinaka uses a Quirk-enhancing drug to take control of the basement level to separate the intruders, Tamaki holding off three members of Overhaul's ""Eight Bullets"" enforcers while Kirishima and Fat Gum are pushed to their limits in defeating the Eight Bullets members Kendo Rappa and Hekiji Tengai, with the former revealing Overhaul's plans. Meanwhile, Izuku's group struggles against Irinaka as Himiko and Twice make their presence known."

"Though Shigaraki loaned the reluctant Himiko and Twice to Overhaul's services as per their agreement, the duo is encouraged by their leader's confidence to act on their own violation to avenge Magne by taking advantage of the raid to sabotage the Shie Hassaikai. They first do this by provoking Irinaka into exposing himself to the heroes, who capture him. Meanwhile, after defeating Shin Nemoto and Deidoro Sakaki, Mirio finds Eri and battles Overhaul, as the crime boss admits that he lied about being Eri's father, revealing that he is actually her uncle. Mirio nearly wins the fight, but Nemoto forces him to take one of the completed Quirk-destroying bullets by firing it at Eri. Mirio continues to fight despite being rendered Quirkless as Izuku, Aizawa and Sir Nighteye arrive in time. Overhaul's subordinate Hari Kurono removes himself and Aizawa from play, revealing Eri to be the previous Hassaikai boss's granddaughter. Overhaul then utilizes his matter-manipulating Quirk to absorb Nemoto and transforms into a four-armed monster, with Nighteye holding him off while Izuku takes Mirio and Eri to safety. Nighteye, having seen a future where Overhaul escapes with Eri and kills Izuku, is mortally wounded while Overhaul uses Nemoto's Quirk to guilt-trip Eri into coming back to him. The fight is interrupted when Toga, posing as Izuku, tricks Ryukyu's team into attacking the basement during their fight with Hassaikai clan member Rikiya Katsukame. Eri is spurred by the heroes' resolve to save her, revealing that her Quirk has the ability to ""rewind"" living things, separating Nemoto from Overhaul while Izuku gets her to safety. Overhaul pursues them after assimilating Rikiya, warning Izuku that continued exposure to Eri's Quirk will rewind him out of existence. This convinces Izuku to use 100% of One of All, with Eri's Quirk healing his injuries as he defeats Overhaul, much to Nighteye's shock.","Though Shigaraki loaned the reluctant Himiko and Twice to Overhaul's services as per their agreement, the duo is encouraged by their leader's confidence to act on their own violation to avenge Magne by taking advantage of the raid to sabotage the Shie Hassaikai.

He manages to defeat Gentle, even after La Brava uses her ""Love"" Quirk to temporarily strengthen him. As the pro-heroes Hound Dog and Ectoplasm approach, Gentle sends Deku while turning himself in to cover for La Brava, with the two getting a chance to redeem themselves. Deku later rejoins his classmates in time for the concert performance, with Jiro performing her original song ""Hero Too"", winning the audience over while making Eri finally smile. As Eri becomes a resident of U.A. under the watchful eyes of Aizawa and the Big Three, Endeavor is officially named the new number-one hero. While meeting with the new number-two hero Hawks, Endeavor is attacked by an intelligent High-End Nomu named ""Hood"" that Dabi releases into the city.","As the culture festival begins, Izuku faces off against Gentle Criminal and manages to subdue him with long-range attacks he learned from All Might.

Meanwhile, All Might concludes his research on the Quirks of the previous One for All owners and delivers it to Izuku. Three months later, on a late March day, the heroes launch an all-out assault on Tomura's mountain base while most hero school students are tasked with a nation-wide evacuation of citizens.","Understanding the Hero Public Safety Commission's reason for the Work Study program to prepare everyone for Tomura's attack, Endeavor accepts Izuku and Bakugo as his students while instructing them and Todoroki to spend their winter break trying to outpace him into intercepting a villain. A week into the work studies, Izuku and Bakugo have dinner at the Todoroki residence with the situation getting uncomfortable due to the family drama involving Todoroki's brother Natsuo being unable to forgive their father for the death of their older brother Toya Todoroki, who burned himself alive after his Quirk went out of control. The following day, Natsuo is kidnapped by a suicidal villain named Ending who wants Endeavor to kill him. Izuku and his friends rescue Natsuo while Endeavor apologizes for failing him as a father, deciding to cut ties with his family for their wellbeing.

"Despite many of the Villains and Paranormal Liberation Front warriors being arrested, Shigaraki and several other high-ranking Villains manage to escape the Heroes, who are forced to deal with their own casualties, while Izuku and the other wounded Heroes are taken to Central Hospital. That same night, the High-Ends and Shigaraki (now fully under the control of All For One) break into Tartarus, freeing All For One's original body and causing numerous Villains to escape in the ensuing carnage. Two days after the battle, most of the wounded recover, but Izuku is revealed to be in a coma. With the public having turned their backs on hero society following the disastrous battle and Dabi's shocking revelations, many Pro Heroes retire in disgrace, while civilians take matters into their own hands against the ongoing villain crisis. Endeavor is visited by his family, including his wife Rei, and Todoroki asks his father for help in taking down Dabi for good. Hawks and Best Jeanist offer to help the Todorokis track him down and restore order to society. Izuku, meanwhile, finds himself in the vestige world and talks to his predecessors. The vestiges reveal to him that One For All slowly kills anyone who already has a Quirk, and that Izuku will almost certainly be the last-ever user due to the Quirkless population declining. Nana asks Izuku if he can kill Shigaraki, leading him to say that he wants to try and save him first. All Might decides to disclose the information about One For All to the Heroes as more information starts to leak out as a result of the battle. Endeavor, Hawks, and Best Jeanist later hold a press conference, in which the former two admit that everything Dabi said was true, and they will stop at nothing to make things right again. With All For One now actively hunting him down in order to steal his Quirk, Izuku is forced to drop out of U.A., leaving farewell letters to his classmates that reveal the truth about One For All.","Despite many of the Villains and Paranormal Liberation Front warriors being arrested, Shigaraki and several other high-ranking Villains manage to escape the Heroes, who are forced to deal with their own casualties, while Izuku and the other wounded Heroes are taken to Central Hospital.

"After the total collapse of hero society following the disastrous Paranormal Liberation War, Izuku teams up with All Might, Endeavor, Hawks, and Best Jeanist, heading out into the crime-ridden cities with the purpose of taking down the escaped convicts and remnants of the Paranormal Liberation Front. After defeating Muscular in a one-sided rematch, Izuku is ambushed by an assassin hired by All For One, a former Pro Hero named Lady Nagant, who turned traitor after discovering the vast corruption within the Hero Public Safety Commission. During the battle, Izuku unlocks the Quirk of the third user, ""Fa Jin"", allowing him to tap into nearly 100% of One For All's power and defeat Nagant. Izuku convinces Nagant to switch sides, believing that she still has the heart of a hero, but her body suddenly explodes due to a self-destruction Quirk All For One gave Nagant without her knowledge. Hawks manages to save Nagant from dying, and she reveals the location of the Villains' supposed hideout, where a video recording of All For One taunts Izuku before detonating a bomb in an attempt to kill the Heroes. Izuku continues to grow more physically and emotionally weary in his pursuit of stopping the villains and keeping everyone safe, even to the point of abandoning All Might and becoming a full-on vigilante. Izuku's exhaustion eventually gets to him and he is almost killed by another of All For One's assassins, until he is suddenly rescued by Bakugo, alerting the rest of Class 1-A that he's found him.","After the total collapse of hero society following the disastrous Paranormal Liberation War, Izuku teams up with All Might, Endeavor, Hawks, and Best Jeanist, heading out into the crime-ridden cities with the purpose of taking down the escaped convicts and remnants of the Paranormal Liberation Front.

"After Izuku drops out of U.A., the rest of Class 1-A declare their intentions to confront him about his decision. Cornering Endeavor, they are able to convince him to let them go out, and eventually manage to track him down. When Izuku refuses to stop his reckless vigilantism and attempts to flee, they end up chasing him down while reminding Izuku of all he's done to each of them and why they want to be with him in order to convince him to return to U.A. Unable to keep him restrained, the class works together and are able to stop Izuku from escaping. Bakugo finally apologizes to Izuku for his relentless bullying during their childhood, which convinces Izuku to give up before he promptly collapses from exhaustion.

Endeavor and Hawks face off against All For One at Gunga Mountain, but Endeavor is incapacitated after All For One uses the distraction of him revealing that he saved Dabi on the night he supposedly died to deliver a knockout blow. Jiro and Tokoyami arrive to save Hawks from being killed and, during the ensuing scuffle, the Quirks that All For One has stolen suddenly begin to rebel against him, allowing Hawks to land a devastating attack that shatters All For One's protective mask. A reinvigorated Endeavor re-enters the fight and unleashes his full power on All For One, seemingly incinerating him - only for the supervillain's old wounds to suddenly begin healing. Elsewhere at U.A., the Heroes find themselves unable to damage the continually mutating Shigaraki, with Bakugo taking a considerable amount of punishment during the fight. Mirio joins the battle, and a comment from him re-awakens the spirit of Tenko Shimura, causing the vestige of All For One inside Shigaraki's mind to realize that they aren't as fully merged as he'd previously believed. Bakugo makes one final attempt to attack Shigaraki by using his ""Explosion"" Quirk at its absolute limit, only for Shigaraki to punch a hole straight through his chest and seemingly kill him as the other heroes look on in horror.","As Dabi's firepower grows increasingly unstable, Todoroki unveils his Ultimate Move, ""Phosphor"", a perfect blend of his ""hot"" and ""cold"" sides that is able to overwhelm Dabi's ""Blueflame"" Quirk and finally knock him out.

"At the same time as Bakugo's apparent demise, Dabi's ""Blueflame"" Quirk undergoes an awakening and he creates his own version of Todoroki's ""Phosphor"" technique to effectively double his firepower, incinerating two of Endeavor's sidekicks while mocking his brother for failing to finish him off. It is also revealed that All For One used a reverse-engineered copy of the Quirk-Destroying Drug to revert himself back to his prime, despite knowing that it will eventually result in him being erased from existence. Back at U.A., Edgeshot uses his Quirk's ultimate technique to turn his entire body into threads and inserts himself into Bakugo's body to save his life, even after Best Jeanist protests that this will surely kill him. As the Heroes continue to fight Shigaraki, his body mutates again into a more powerful form and he quickly defeats most of them. However, Mirio manages to hold off Shigaraki long enough for the electrical barrier around U.A. to be opened, allowing a returning Izuku to join the fight. While he initially goes berserk after seeing Bakugo's lifeless body, Mirio is able to calm him down. Izuku confronts the vestige of All For One inside Shigaraki's mind about his condition, and while the former claims that the latter has been completely assimilated, Mirio's revelation about his previous outburst leads them to realize that he's still trying to break free of his master's control. Unlocking the Quirk of the Second User, ""Gearshift"", Izuku utilizes the full power of One For All to completely overwhelm Shigaraki in battle. Meanwhile, Spinner and his army of mutants, consisting of Paranormal Liberation Front soldiers and rioting civilians, storm Central Hospital to free Kurogiri. Mezo Shoji and Koji Koda help defend the hospital, sympathizing with their fellow mutants' plight while still striving to protect the innocent civilians inside. Spinner's deteriorating mental state, caused by him being given extra Quirks by All For One, prevents him from leading the mutants and they stand down after seeing him massacre a group of hospital workers. Spinner still manages to make it to Kurogiri's containment cell and, despite Present Mic's best efforts, is able to awaken him by pleading with him to save Shigaraki. Kurogiri then begins warping the Villains to their ""proper"" battlefields, including sending Dabi to his father's location at the Gunga Mountain, as well as Toga, who has used Twice's blood to transform into him and create an army of clones.","At the same time as Bakugo's apparent demise, Dabi's ""Blueflame"" Quirk undergoes an awakening and he creates his own version of Todoroki's ""Phosphor"" technique to effectively double his firepower, incinerating two of Endeavor's sidekicks while mocking his brother for failing to finish him off.
