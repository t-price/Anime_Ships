1,"Four days after the villains' invasion on USJ, Class 1-A returns there to resume their rescue training. Thirteen and Aizawa oversee the exercises, however, a mysterious villain who had apparently been hiding in the complex since the USJ incident takes out Todoroki and attacks the class. Although Thirteen and Aizawa urge the students to run away, they instead take on the villain together. When this fails, Midoriya devises a strategy to rescue Todoroki and attack the villain at the same time, resulting in him getting stuck onto Mineta's spheres. The villain then reveals himself to be All Might in disguise and had planned this as a 'surprise' for the students so they could stay on their toes following the USJ attack; the students are annoyed by the deception.","Four days after the villains' invasion on USJ, Class 1-A returns there to resume their rescue training.

3,"After the hero internships, Aizawa announces that Class 1-A will participate in an amicable training exercise alongside four heroes-in-training from Isamu High School. One of them is Tsuyu's old friend, the snakelike Habuko, while another student, Fujimi, instantly clashes with Bakugo. All Might explains that the training exercise will split the twenty-four students into six groups of four, with the goal just being to outlast all the other teams. Since the survival battle royale setup puts Midoriya's team (composed of him, Uraraka, Tsuyu, and Ashido) at a disadvantage, they decide to lay low. Meanwhile, Bakugo quickly takes out a couple of other teams, but during a clash with the Isamu students, Fujimi releases his ""Zombie Virus"" Quirk which turns people into zombie-like creatures. As all the students become eventually infected by the virus, including Fujimi himself, only Midoriya, Todoroki, Uraraka, and Ashido manage to escape; even All Might's attempt to rescue them fails when he transforms into his skeletal form, which is confused as being a zombie by the actual zombies. The four survivors hole up in a cave, and just as Midoriya and Todoroki stage a frontal attack on the zombies, the effects of the Zombie Virus are reversed and the students are returned to normal. With the training exercise concluded and everyone's injuries patched up, the Isamu students bid farewell to 1-A, while an injured Midoriya still lies in bed, having been attacked by a rage-induced Bakugo.","After the hero internships, Aizawa announces that Class 1-A will participate in an amicable training exercise alongside four heroes-in-training from Isamu High School.

The finals for this year are against bitter rivals Gang Orca and Shishido, each determined to take the win over the other. Gang Orca's ""Orcas"" include his Agency trainees, as well as members of Team Lurkers, while Shishido's ""Lionels"" include his Agency trainees, and members of Fat Gum's Agency. Present Mic narrates the game, accompanied by an extremely apathetic Eraser Head, explaining the rules, including that full Quirk use is fair, and that if a player is knocked out they are out of the game. The game ends up becoming incredibly brutal as the players freely use their Quirks to their advantage, and promptly being pummelled by their team captain upon their failures. Almost all the players end up also being knocked unconscious due to the tenacity involved, leaving Gang Orca and Shishido the only ones remaining. Right as the game is tied 1-1, they are suddenly alerted to a bank robber escaping nearby. Without hesitating, the two Heroes speed off and swiftly work together to take out the thug, leaving him to the remaining players to watch over. The two return to the field for their final pitch, however both Heroes end up knocked unconscious by their throw and swing, ending the game in a tied; despite this outcome, they each declare their love for baseball, while the rest of the players return home in agony.","The ""Hero League Baseball"" is an organization set-up by several Pro Heroes to allow them the chance to play and compete in their spare time.
